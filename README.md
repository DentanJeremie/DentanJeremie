### Hi there üëã

- üéì I'm a master's student in Machine Learning at √âcole Polytechnique Paris and MVA ENS Paris-Saclay.
- üî≠ For my research I'm interested in a wide range of ML topics, including NLP, ML on graphs, AI safety and reliability, geometric data analysis. I'm also interested in interdisciplinary applications of ML, whether in biology, physics, or medicine.
- üöÄ I have a strong interest for the industrial challenges related to the developpment of high performance products, whether they are business challenges (agile development, user experience, etc) or technical challenges (software architecture, high performance computing, etc).
- üìñ Here is the link to me ReasearchGate profile, I publish here most of the academic work I do: [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremie-Dentan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremie-Dentan)
- ‚úâÔ∏è You can reach me: [jeremie.dentan@polytechnique.org](mailto:jeremie.dentan@polytechnique.org)
