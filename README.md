### Hi, I'm J√©r√©mie üëã

- üìù I'm a PhD candidate in ML security and privacy, co-supervised by √âcole Polytechnique Paris and Cr√©dit Agricole DataLab Groupe.
- üéì In 2023 I graduated from MVA master at ENS Paris-Saclay and engineering degree at √âcole Polytechnique
- üî≠ For my research I'm interested in a wide range of ML topics, including ML privacy, language models, or AI safety and reliability. I'm also interested in interdisciplinary applications of ML, whether in biology, physics, or medicine.
- üêç My main IT language is Python. I also have strong knowledge in Java, Javascript, HTML, and some practice in PHP, C++ and D3.
- üöÄ I have a strong interest for the industrial challenges related to the developpment of high performance products, whether they are business challenges (agile development, user experience, etc) or technical challenges (software architecture, high performance computing, etc).
