### Hi, I'm Jérémie 👋

- 🎓 I'm a master's student in Machine Learning at École Polytechnique Paris and MVA ENS Paris-Saclay.
- 🔭 For my research I'm interested in a wide range of ML topics, including NLP, ML on graphs, AI safety and reliability, geometric data analysis. I'm also interested in interdisciplinary applications of ML, whether in biology, physics, or medicine.
- 🐍 My main IT language is Python. I also have strong knowledge in Java, Javascript, HTML, and some practice in PHP, C++ and D3.
- 🚀 I have a strong interest for the industrial challenges related to the developpment of high performance products, whether they are business challenges (agile development, user experience, etc) or technical challenges (software architecture, high performance computing, etc).
